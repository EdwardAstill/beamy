========================================
Elevated:
========================================
Max pin distance: 85 mm
Force on each column: 6557.985000000001 N
Moment on each beam: 557428.7250000001 Nmm
Applied height: 1111 mm

Supports:
All the base RHS are fixed (all 250x150x6 RHS are fixed)

Loads:
- Moments and force applied to each beam (the moment should bend the e.g.+ or neg y vector)



========================================
Lifted:
========================================
Max pin distance: 85 mm
Force on each column: 6557.985000000001 N
Moment on each beam: 557428.7250000001 Nmm
Applied height: 875 mm
Lift angle: 61.91590063330886 degrees
Base force (sling and structure weight): 16475.698800000002 N


Loads:
- Moments and force applied to each beam (the moment should bend the e.g.+ or neg y vector)
- Force on all base members totalling to base force (either base member or base supports)


Supports:
choose 2 nodes on the bottom base and fix their x and y coordinates, and let the z coordinate be free.
fix the lifting point in z direction
